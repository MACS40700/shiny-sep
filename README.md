# Shiny sep

Examples here include running a shiny app from two separate files -- 

* ui file has the user interface for a shiny app
    * note: fresh code included for customizing dashboard
* server has the server side for a shiny app
* www folder holds custom css for a shiny app
* babyNames.RDS data file (note: last tab of dashboard will not work without state data)
